# Say-no-to-plastics

A demonic wave in disguise of convenience engulfed the world in the late 1950’s in the form of plastics.  That was the beginning of the so called ‘Plastic Age’. Plastics, sadly, have been an essential part of the life on earth. Aquatic life, human life and animal life were slowly yet effectively getting a taste of the overpowering plastic dependency of the industrial world.  A report on Marine Pollution by Jenna R. Jambeck in the year 2015 highlights plastic waste from land entering the waters highlights the negative effects of ocean gyres, whirlpooling plastic waste thus further fragmenting it down to microplastics. These microplastics are ingested by invertebrates due to their miniscule nature.
